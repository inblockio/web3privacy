    Note over DApp,PrivateEncryptionService: Setup

		DApp->>DApp: Generate: Sender generates an encryption key for a specified method
		DApp->>PrivateEncryptionService: Sends persistant "private file encryption key" (totally independant of the wallet signing key)
		DApp->>RSAPublicKeyStorageContract: Publish public file encryption key (specified method and the public key)
		
		Note over DApp,PrivateEncryptionService: Encrypting a file using a key managed by PrivateEncryptionService

		DApp->>RSAPublicKeyStorageContract: Request the receivers file "public encryption key" associated with their wallet addresses
		RSAPublicKeyStorageContract-->>DApp: Returns the receiver's public keys
        DApp->>DApp: Generate symmetric key
		DApp->>PrivateEncryptionService: Upload symmetric key with "public encryption key" 
		
		PrivateEncryptionService->>PrivateEncryptionService: Generate cyphers of symmetric key for each receiver public keys
    PrivateEncryptionService-->>DApp: Return cyphers of symmetric key for each receiver public keys

    DApp->>DApp: Encrypt file with symmetric key
    DApp->>DApp: Prefix encrypted file with receivers public keys and associated cyphers

    DApp->>Storage: Store file
		
    Note over DApp,PrivateEncryptionService: Decrypting a file using a key managed by PrivateEncryptionService
    Storage-->>DApp: Retrieve file prefixed with receivers public keys and associated cyphers
    PrivateEncryptionService-->>DApp: Get receiver "public encryption key"
    DApp->>DApp: Parse prefix for cypher associated with receiver "public encryption key" 
    DApp-->>PrivateEncryptionService: Send cypher of symmetric key
    PrivateEncryptionService->>PrivateEncryptionService: Decrypt cypher in turn computing symmetric key
    PrivateEncryptionService-->>DApp: Retrieve symmetric key
    DApp->>DApp: Decrypt file with symmetric key
    DApp->>DApp: Display or download decrypted file
