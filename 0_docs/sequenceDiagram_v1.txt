    Note over DApp,MetaMask Snap: Setup snap

		DApp->>DApp: Generate: Sender generates an encryption key for a specified method
		DApp->>MetaMask Snap: Sends persistant "private file encryption key" (totally independant of the wallet signing key) into the snap
		DApp->>ENS: Publish public file encryption key (specified method and the public key)
		
		Note over DApp,MetaMask Snap: Encrypting a file using a key managed by Snap

		DApp->>ENS: Request the receivers file "public encryption key" from ENS with the wallet address
		ENS-->>DApp: Returns the receiver's public keys
		DApp->>MetaMask Snap: Upload symmetric key with "public encryption key" via Snap API 
		
		MetaMask Snap->>MetaMask Snap: Generate cyphers of symmetric key for each receiver public keys
    MetaMask Snap-->>DApp: Return cyphers of symmetric key for each receiver public keys

    DApp->>DApp: Encrypt file with symmetric key
    DApp->>DApp: Prefix encrypted file with receivers public keys and associated cyphers

    DApp->>Storage: Store file
		
    Note over DApp,MetaMask Snap: Decrypting a file using a key managed by Snap
    Storage-->>DApp: Retrieve file prefixed with receivers public keys and associated cyphers
    MetaMask Snap-->>DApp: Get receiver "public encryption key"
    DApp->>DApp: Parse prefix for cypher associated with receiver "public encryption key" 
    DApp-->>MetaMask Snap: Send cypher of symmetric key
    MetaMask Snap->>MetaMask Snap: Decrypt cypher in turn computing symmetric key
    MetaMask Snap-->>DApp: Retrieve symmetric key
    DApp->>DApp: Decrypt file with symmetric key
    DApp->>DApp: Display or download decrypted file
